                        travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of
                        ten
                        or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed,
                        tried
                        to
                        clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched
                        along
                        with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                        bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
                        nothing
                        can
                        moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.</span>

                    <span class="main-item__subtitle-txt opacity">The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the
                        platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the
                        most
                        reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
                        please
                        the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                        Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                        revolvers
                        upon them.</span>


                    <span class="main-item__subtitle-txt opacity">"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go
                        by in a procession, just as if they
                        were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
                        programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of
                        beasts!"</span>
